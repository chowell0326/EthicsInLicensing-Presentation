prompt
---------------------
Do some research on the open source license concept called copyleft licensing and the open source concept called permissive licensing.
Using the following licenses for your comparison:
    
    - Microsoft Windows 11 Home or Pro license
    - MacOS license
    - GPL v3
    - AGPL v3
    - Apache 2.0
    - BSD 3 clause
    
Explain the concepts of commercial and open source licensing, and specifically the concepts behind a copyleft and permissive open source license.  
For each of the licenses, read each carefully and compare and contrast them.  Discuss what you are legally allowed and not allowed to do with software licensed under each of them, and what you must do if you incorporate the source of software into another software package.   
For each license, consider if there times when using the software licensed under each may be legal but unethical, or vise versa?  Explain.
    
Also review this article: [https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/jun/23/rhel-gpl-analysis/](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/jun/23/rhel-gpl-analysis/) and discuss the ethics and legality of what RedHat is doing with their code released under the GPLv2.
    
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation covering your research paper topics on commercial and open source licenses.
